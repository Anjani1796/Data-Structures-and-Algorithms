# Performance and Limitations
## Performance: Let n be the number of elements in the queue, then :
| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| Space Complexity (for n EnQueue operations) | O(n) |
| Time Complexity of EnQueue() | O(1) |
| Time Complexity of DeQueue() | O(1) |
| Time Complexity of IsEmptyQueue() | O(1) |
| Time Complexity of IsFullQueue() | O(1) |
| Time Complexity of QueueSize() | O(1) |
| Time Complexity of DeleteQueue() | O(1) |
