## Computational Complexity Analysis
There are only two things on which everything in Computer Science depends
- ```Time Complexity : The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of computer time it needs to run to completion. ``` 
- ```Space Complexity : The space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of memory it needs to run to completion. ```
