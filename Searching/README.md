# Searching

#### *Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.*
- Sorting refers to the operation of arranging data in some given order, such as increasing or decreasing with numerical data, or alphabetically with character data.

## Types of sorting :–
- **Internal Sorting -** Sorts the data resides in the computer’s memory. Example - Selection sort, Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Heap sort, Bucker Sort, etc
- **External Sorting -** Deals with sorting the data stored in files. External sorting is applied when there is large amount of data that cannot be stored in memory. Example- Multiway merging

## Complexity Analysis

| Sl No. | Algorithm | Worst Time | Average Time | Best Time | Memory |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: 
| 1. | Linear Search | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) | O(1)|
| 2. | Binary Search | O( log(n) ) | O( log(n) ) | O(1) | O(1) |
| 2. | Interpolation Search | O(n) | O( log(log(n))) |  | O(1) |
