# Sorting
*Sorting refers to the operation of arranging data in some given order, such as increasing or decreasing with numerical data, or alphabetically with character data.*

| 1. | Bubble Sort | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(n) | O(1) | Stable |
| 2. | Selection Sort | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(1) | Unstable |
| 3. | Insertion Sort | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(1) | Stable |
| 4. | Merge Sort | O(n * log n ) | O(n * log n ) | O(n * log n ) | O(n) | Stable |
| 5. | Quick Sort | O(n * log n ) | O(n log n ) | O(n^2 )  | O( log n ) | Unstable |
| 6. | Bucket Sort  | O(n^2 * k) ) | O(n * k) |  | | |
| 7. | Heap Sort  | O(n * log n) | O(n * log n) |  | | |
| 8. | Shell Sort  | O(n * (log n)^2 ) | |  | | |

> **Stable** : Relative position of equal elements after sorting remains same.
>
> **In-place Sorting** : Sorting Input elements without having backup, thus unsorted form is lost.
